<ol>
  <li>
 someone who works their entire life for other people and never has time to grow their own personal wealth.
 </li>
 <li>
 Their livelihood (and their family’s) is dependent on the decisions of someone else, ie the persons boss.

 They are one lay-off away from serious financial problems.

 The idea of retiring only happens when the government allows it.

<div class = "larger"> "Our goal is to get you out of the Chump Life" </div>

 Our goal is to teach you how to embrace the Chump Life (we all have to start somewhere) and how to get out of it as quickly as possible.

The idea of this blog relies on the stipulation that information can be used to increase one’s output thus increasing one’s standard of living and/or living situation. This may seem like a pretty standard assumption but for the most part people more times than not choose a worse of decision even after they have better information. Knowing that you can make $15 dollars an hour as an employee at Starbucks but only $8 at Walmart. Yet there are still people working at Walmart. While there is quality of labor differences and harder requirements to get the job at Starbucks. The reality still exists that you can use information to reach your goals what ever they may be quicker by using information.
<br><br>

Ok now that we know that we can use information to make better decisions we need to focus on the decisions that make the most impact. The largest value addativate task you can do is get a job to make money, or invest time for a business that may or may not work. The seperation between work and hobby's has split especailly in the modern era. The path is no longer to have work as an income and have no other potential business. The idea of a full time career man is antiquity. We have to remain nimble and have multiple venues of value creations. The best way to go is through the path of least resistance (I mean who likes work?). This path of least resistance is along where you already enjoy the work. I have watched bankers become programmers due to following hobbies. Being an amateur is thing of greatness. There are no pressures and the only reason you are doing it is because you enjoy the act of doing. Hobbies are the training ground to which we launch our beach head assult on life. Practicing skill sets or learning pathways can result in unexpected chance meetings or further discover of more lucrative ventures.

Here are questions I hear all the time that are simply not true: <br><br>

Some of these things that we all know could make our lives better but we choose not to change them are locality, learning new skill sets or investing in education, and seeking your network for information that you can use to better your situation.



The person not living the Chump Life is able to continually maximize their time and energy. These people can recognize what is the best source for their time and focus in on doing that. Many aspects of recognizing what is the best use of your time can largely be brought into the study of economics and what is the most available use of time given the what resources are available. We live in exponential times, technology grows at an exorbant rate. People that stay relevant are able to stay ahead of this curve and not behind it. Technology by nature not only creates wealth but also destroys it. Ask the people in who used to work in manufacturing, most of domestic manufacturing has moved offshore due to technology. Robots replace low-skill works at an increasing rate. The primary feature of not living the Chump Life can be views as the collision between the most growing source of wealth and the ability to adapt. Economies grow disportortionately with in sectors that cultivate innovation and technological progress. You do not need to become a programmer to stay in front of the curve rather you have to realize what is growing industry and what is a waning one. This helps you make long term decisions to position yourself were your hours spent working are maximized. People who go from low-middle income to very wealthy in one lifetime are those how can stay relevant
